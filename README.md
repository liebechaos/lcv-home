# lcv-home

This is the source code for the Liebe Chaos Verein-Homepage.
It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so you don't need to know anything 
about programming to add content to it.

## How can I add my thing?

If you want to add a Verein-activity to the site you need to create a file with
a text about it in the right folder. If you have a Github-account you can [click
here](https://github.com/liebechaos/lcv-home/new/master/content/activity) and 
start writing immediately.

Start by pasting this bit into the file

```
---
title: "hello"
date: 2019-11-21T18:00:00+01:00
---
```

then, replace the title and date with something meaningful such as the start of
this activity you are writing about. The date needs to be written in the same way
as it is above.

Save the file with a name ending in `.md` and create a pull request with the
form below the text editor.

## How do I deploy it?

A Github Action is setup to deploy all pull requests merged into `master`.

Alternatively, a shell script can be made based on `./deploy.sample.sh`, which contains 
the commands necessary to deploy the site. You need to edit in your ssh account details.

## I have a question
