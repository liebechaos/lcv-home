Love Chaos Quarantine was an adhoc online festival during the spring of 2020. 

As so many of us are stuck in the house or flat and parts of our daily lives are very different than they usually are, we wanted to find a way to still hang out and share things with each other.

Love Chaos Quarantine is a platform that initiates and hosts conversations, lectures, concerts, workshops and any other kinds of sessions.

All are invited to use Love Chaos Quarantine to organise events and hang outs.
